<h1>mireka.xml</h1>
		
<kbd>mireka.xml</kbd> is the primary configuration file of Mireka. 
It configures the SMTP service, 
the filter chain, and most filter parameters. It is imported by 
<kbd>resin-web.xml</kbd> in the Mireka web application archive during runtime. 
<kbd>mireka.xml</kbd> in turn imports most of the other configuration 
files. 

<p>
These configuration files will be read and processed by Resin. 
Essentially, they control what objects must be created in runtime. The name of a tag 
is a Java class name. An element assigns a value to a property of the object. 
It is also possible to specify another objest as a property value, either 
defining it inline, or referencing it by an EL expression.    
For more information on the syntax, see the Resin documentation.
