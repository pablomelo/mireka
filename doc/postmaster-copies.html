<h1>Postmaster mail copies</h1>

<p>
All mails sent to the special <kbd>Postmaster</kbd> addresses are saved into the
<code><var>MIREKA_HOME</var>/postmaster</code> directory. They are sent to their assigned 
destination as well. There are two types of postmaster addresses. In the 
first form, no domain is specified. This is always accepted. In the second form, 
domain part is also specified. These are only accepted if the domain is a local 
domain. This feature is useful for debugging. The saved file shows the content 
of the message before any processing. The mails are saved even if an error
occurs later in the processing chain, e.g. the back-end server cannot be 
connected in proxy mode.

<p>You may need to clear the directory occasionally.</p>
