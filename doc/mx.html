<h1>SMTP Service</h1>
		
<p>The SMTP service receives mails sent to the local domains by any server on the 
internet. The service, in turn, relays all received mails to the backend server,
delivers them locally, expands it to a mail list, etc. 
It always runs on port 25, and its address must be published in a DNS MX 
record.
</p>

<p>
<code>mx.js</code> is the most strongly associated configuration file. 
It configures the SMTP service, the filter chain, and most filter parameters.

<ul>
<li>SMTP server: accepts incoming connections, sends mail transactions to the 
filter chain
<li><a href="filters.html">filter chain</a>: filters are responsible for the 
processing of incoming mail transactions.
</ul>
