		<h1>First steps after installation</h1>

<p>After installating Mireka, you have to configure the following settings, which has no sensible defaults.
<h3>Server name</h3>
The server identifies itself for others with its domain name. 
If this server will send mails to external servers, then it is important to setup this correctly. 
In this case always use the fully qualified domain name of the server. 
Otherwise you should come up with something meaningful for you.   
<p>Edit <code>mireka.js</code> and change the value of the <code>helo</code> variable. 
For example if your server is named <code>mail.example.com</code> the result should look like this:
<p class="code">...
var helo="<span class="relevant">mail.example.com</span>";
...
</p>

<h3>SRS key</h3>
<p>If Mireka will be configured to sometime forward incoming mail to an external server, than it has to use a mechanism named SRS to successfully deliver the mail. 
SRS needs a secret key. Choose a random hexadecimal value which should be about 32 characters long.
<p>Edit <code>mireka.js</code>, uncomment the <code>secretKey</code> line and edit its value. 
For example if you have choosen <code>12AB34CD</code> as the secret,  the result should look like this:
<p class="code">...
	<span class="relevant">secretKey: "12AB34CD",</span>
...
</p>

<h3>Postmaster</h3>
If your server is not only a proxy, then you have to designate a user as the postmaster. 
Do this after you have setup user accounts.  
See the page <a href="postmaster.html">Designate the Postmaster</a> for instructions.
<p>

<h3>Mailer-daemon name and address</h3>
You have to change the mailer daemon address at the top of the <code>submission/queues.js</code>
configuration file, to reflect your own domain. The mailer daemon address is used as the <cite>from</cite> 
address in automatically generated delivery status notification mails.
