		<h1>Adding an alias</h1>
		
<p>Alias is a virtual recipient address which is mapped to another local recipient address.
Mails sent to the alias are handled exactly as if they were sent to the other address.

<p>Edit <code>local-recipients.js</code> and insert the new alias mapping below the 
comment <cite>ENTER YOUR RECIPIENT-DESTINATION MAPPINGS HERE</cite>.
For example if you have a user account with the name <code>jane</code>, and you want 
to define an alternative address, <code>jeannie</code> for her, you shoud insert the following line:
<p class=code>...
<span class="relevant">alias("jeannie@example.com", "jane@example.com"),</span>
...</p>

<p>From now, mails sent to <code>jeannie@example.com</code> will be delivered to the 
existing maildrop named <code>jane</code>.
<p>Note: both addresses must be local addresses.
