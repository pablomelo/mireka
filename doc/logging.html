<h1>Logging</h1>

<h2>Log files</h2>

Log files are in the <code><var>MIREKA_HOME</var>/log</code> directory.

<h3><code>error.log</code></h3>
It contains errors and warnings. If everything goes well, it should only contain
startup and shutdown messages.

<h3><code>access.log</code></h3>
It contains every SMTP command received or sent and some additional information 
from  
filters. It contains errors and warnings as well. If you have more then 100 000 
mail transactions per day, then you may want to switch on buffering on this log.

<h3><code>unknown-user.log</code></h3>
Every recipients, which are rejected because they are not in the list of 
valid recipients, although they are addressed to a local domain, are logged in 
this file. This log file is useful on a fresh installation of Mireka, to
make sure that no valid recipients are rejected because of wrong configuration. 
By default it is switched off.

<h2>Configuring logging</h2>
Mireka uses the Logback logging library. 
The log configuration file is <code><var>MIREKA_HOME</var>/conf/logback.xml</code>. 
For more information, see the <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">documentation of Logback</a>.
