<h1>Administration</h1>
	
<p>
For the administration of the Resin application server, see the 
<a href="http://www.caucho.com/resin/">documentation</a> of Resin.
</p>

Log files are located in two places: 
<ul>
<li><kbd>${resin.dir>/log</kbd>
<li><kbd>${mirekaHome}/log</kbd>
</ul>

<h3>${resin.dir>/log/jvm-default.log</h3>
It contains errors and warnings. If everything goes well, it should only contain
startup and shutdown messages.

<h3>${mirekaHome}/log/access.log</h3>
It contains every SMTP command received or sent and some additional information 
from  
filters. It contains errors and warnings as well. If you have more then 100 000 
mail transactions per day, then you may want to switch on buffering on this log.

<h3>${mirekaHome}/log/unknown-user.log</h3>
Every recipients, which are rejected because they are not in the list of 
valid recipients, although they are addressed to a local domain, are logged in 
this file. This log file is useful on a fresh installation of Mireka, to
make sure that no valid recipients are rejected because of wrong configuration. 
It can be switched off later.

<h3>Traffic statistics</h3>

The <a href="javadoc/index.html?mireka/filter/builtin/MeasureTraffic.html"><code>MeasureTraffic</code></a>
filter publishes statistics in a JMX MBean object under the name 
<kbd>mireka:type=TrafficSummary</kbd>. 
It can be displayed either in the  
administration pages of Resin, or using the jconsole application of the JDK.  

<h3>Postmaster mails</h3>

<p>
All mails sent to the special <kbd>Postmaster</kbd> addresses are saved into the
<kbd>{mirekaHome}/postmaster</kbd> directory. They are relayed to 
the back-end server as well. There are two types of postmaster addresses. In the 
first form, no domain is specified. This is always accepted. In the second form, 
domain part is also specified. These are only accepted if the domain is a local 
domain. This feature is useful for debugging. The saved file shows the content 
of the message before any processing. The mails are saved even if the back-end 
server cannot be connected. 
</p>

<p>
You may need to clear the directory occasionally.
