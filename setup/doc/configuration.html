<h1>How to Configure Mireka</h1>
		
<p>Mireka is using the Resin application server for configuration and startup.
Therefore it is distibuted in a standard Java Web Application archive, although 
currently it has no web interface. In the unlikely event, that some additonal  
configuration of Resin is needed, other than what was already done during 
installation, you can find more information about Resin on its web site at
<a href="http://www.caucho.com/products/resin/">http://www.caucho.com/products/resin/</a>.
In the following only configuration options related to Mireka itself are described.
</p>

<p>
Mireka configuration files are located in the <kbd>${mirekaHome}/conf/</kbd> 
directory.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th><a href="mireka.xml.html">mireka.xml</a></th><td>configures the SMTP service, 
the filter chain, and most filter parameters.</td></tr>
<tr><th>domains.xml</th><td>list of local domain names. 
If the domain part of a recipient is not in this list, then the recipient will 
be rejected.
<p>This file is imported by <kbd>mireka.xml</kbd>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>users.xml</th><td>simple user addresses, like 
<kbd>john@example.com</kbd>. If a recipient equals with a user adress supplied  
here then it will be accepted (assuming other conditions are also met). 
<p>This file is imported by <kbd>mireka.xml</kbd>.</p>  </td></tr>
<tr><th>addresses.xml</th><td>more complex address specificatons, like
<cite>"any recipient which includes <kbd>bounce</kbd> in its local part, and of which 
remote part is <kbd>lists.example.com</kbd>"</cite>.
<p>This file is imported by <kbd>mireka.xml</kbd>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>logback.xml</th><td>configures logging.
For more information, see the documentation of 
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a>.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>
The import structure of configuration files should be considered as an example. 
It is possible to include all data in <kbd>mireka.xml</kbd>. It is also possible 
to divide the configuration into more files than what is supplied by default.
