<h3>How does Mireka store configuration</h3>

<p>Mireka configuration is stored in text files. 
The configuration files are written in the JavaScript programming language, 
although only the most basic elements of JavaScript is used. The configuration does two things:
<ul>
	<li>Sets up Mireka components and wire them together.
	<li>Sets up mailing specific informations, like user accounts, forwading lists etc.
</ul>

<h3>Location of configuration files</h3>

The location of the configuration files depends on how you installed Mireka.
<ul>
	<li>If you installed it by extracting the zip distribution archive then they are in the <code>conf</code> subdirectory.
	<li>If you installed the deb package then they are in <code>/etc/mireka/</code>.
</ul>

<h3>Editing</h3>

It is best if you edit the files using an editor capable of syntax highlighting JavaScript files.
For example you can use Vim on the Linux command line, or jEdit on Windows and Linux GUI.

<!-- <h3>How does the changes take effect</h3> -->

<p><b>After changing the configuration you have to restart Mireka.</b>
