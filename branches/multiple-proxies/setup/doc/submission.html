<h1>How to Configure the Submission Service</h1>
		
<p>
The Submission service is used by local users to send mails to either 
other local users, or to other domains on the internet. The service, in turn, 
transmits mails to the public SMTP server of the recipient domain. 
This service is specified by 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4409">RFC 4409, Message Submission for Mail</a>.
If this service is enabled, then Mireka becomes a standalone 
<def>Message Submission Agent (MSA)</def>.
</p>
<p>
If it cannot transmit a mail on the first attempt, then it retries the
transmission several times. If it eventually decides that the mail is 
undeliverable, then it sends a delivery status notification message back to the 
sender.
</p>
<p>
A dedicated MSA is useful for people, who are working outside of the office, 
and whose internet service provider blocks port 25.
The service usually runs on port 587. Its address is NOT published in a DNS MX 
record.
</p>

<p>
Configuration files specific to the Submission service are located in the 
<kbd>${mirekaHome}/conf/submission</kbd> directory.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>submission.xml</th><td>primary configuration file of the Submission 
service. It configures the SMTP server, the filter chain, and most 
filter parameters. In turn, it imports all the other configuration files of 
the Submission service.
Sections:
<ul>
<li>SMTP server: accepts incoming connections, sends mail transactions to the 
filter chain
<li><a href="filters.html">filter chain</a>: Filters are responsible for the 
processing of submitted mail transactions.
<li>recipient table: it does not have any interesting role in this service, it 
just specifies that all recipients must be transmitted to the mail server of
the recipient's domain.
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>authorized-ip.xml</th><td>list of ip addresses or address ranges. 
Mails can be submitted from these ip addresses without further authentication of 
the sender.
<p>This file is imported by <kbd>submission.xml</kbd>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th><a href="global-users.html">global-users.xml</a></th><td>list of users 
who are authorized to use this submission service.</td></tr>
<tr><th>queues.xml</th><td>The submission service uses file system based 
queues to make sure no mails are lost. Until a mail is confirmed to be received
by the recipient domain the mail stays in a queue. The queues are managed by 
transmitters.
In the default configuration there are three transmitters and there are
three correspongind queues.
<ul>
<li>primaryTransmitter: all mails go into the queue of this transmitter. 
This transmitter is responsible for the first delivery attempt.
<li>dsnTransmitter: if it becomes clear that a mail cannot be transmitted then 
the transmitter responsible for the mail generates a Delivery Status Notification
(DSN) message. This transmitter is responbible for transmitting the DSN messages
back to the original sender.
<li>retryTransmitter: if the first attempt to transmit a mail (either a regular
mail or a DSN message) is unsuccessful, but it seems that the problem is temporary,
then the original transmitter handles the message to this transmitter. 
retryTransmitter retries the transmission several times. If it cannot transmit
the mail after a predefined count of attempts, or if it becomes clear, that 
no further attempt will be successful, then it generates a DSN message and
drops the original mail.
</ul>
You have to change the mailer daemon address at the top of the file, to reflect 
your own domain. Otherwise it is unlikely that you have to change other parts 
of this configuration file.
