<h1>How to Configure the Submission Service</h1>
		
<p>
The Submission service is used by local users to send mails to either 
other local users, or to other domains on the internet. The service, in turn, 
relays all submitted mails to the backend server. This service is specified by 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4409">RFC 4409, Message Submission for Mail</a>.
The combination of the Submission service of Mireka and the backend SMTP server 
constitute a <def>Message Submission Agent (MSA)</def>.
A dedicated MSA is useful for people, who are working outside of the office, 
and whose internet service provider blocks port 25.
The service usually runs on port 587. Its address is NOT published as a DNS MX 
record.
</p>

<p>
Configuration files specific to the Submission service are located in the 
<kbd>${mirekaHome}/conf/submission</kbd> directory.
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>submission.xml</th><td>primary configuration file of the Submission 
service. It configures the SMTP server, the filter chain, and most 
filter parameters. In turn, it imports all the other configuration files of 
the Submission service.
Sections:
<ul>
<li>SMTP server: accepts incoming connections, sends mail transactions to the 
filter chain
<li><a href="filters.html">filter chain</a>: Filters are responsible for the 
processing of submitted mail transactions.
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>authorized-ip.xml</th><td>list of ip addresses or address ranges. 
Mails can be submitted from these ip addresses without further authentication of 
the sender.
<p>This file is imported by <kbd>submission.xml</kbd>.</p></td></tr>
<tr><th>global-users.xml</th><td>list of users who are authorized to use this
Submission service. It contains username, password pairs. Message User Agents
must authenticate in the SMTP session using these accounts before submitting a 
message.
<p>
Note: If the MX service is 
enabled, then the users listed here become valid wildcard recipients in the MX 
service too. Because the list contains the local-part of addresses only, they 
will be accepted with any local domain on their right side. For example, the 
list contains the user <kbd>john</kbd>, and <kbd>example.com</kbd> and 
<kbd>example.org</kbd> are both local domains. In this case the MX service 
accepts both <kbd>john@example.com</kbd> and <kbd>john@example.org</kbd>.
</p>
<p>This file is part of the Submission service configuration, but it is imported
by <kbd>mireka.xml</kbd>, so both MX and Submission service can use it.
