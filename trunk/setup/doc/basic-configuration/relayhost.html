		<h1>Sending all outgoing mails via another server</h1>
		
<p>Mireka can be configured to send all outgoing mail through another server. 
The other server is usually the so called <i>smarthost</i>. This is useful for 
example if the local network connects to the internet through a dynamic IP 
address. 
<p>
In contrast to proxy mode, Mireka in this case waits until it 
completely receives the incoming mail, stores it, and forwards them later, 
usually within a few milliseconds. Mireka tries to send to the configured 
smarthost (or smarthosts, see later), and if is not successful, it try it again 
later, up to the configured duration.
<p><i>NOTE: 
If it turns out that the mail cannot be relayed for some reason, then Mireka 
sends a Delivery Status Notification mail back to the original sender. However,
if the original sender is not a local user, this bounce mail must also go through 
the smarthost. If the smarthost is inaccessible for an extended time, Mireka 
will give up, and delete the DSN mail too. Depending on the importance of the 
mails this can be a dangerous situation because the mail is accepted but  
neither the mail is delivered, nor the user is notified. To prevent this, 
configure appropriate retry intervals and regularly monitor the mail error logs.
</i><p>

<p>First edit <code>mireka.js</code> and configure the value of the 
<code>backendServer</code> variable. For example if the smarthost is 
<code>myisp.example.com</code>, listens on port 587, and requires authentication, 
then your configuration should look like this:
<p class="code">...
backendServer = setup(BackendServer, {
	host: "<span class="relevant">myisp.example.com</span>",
	<span class="relevant">port: 587,</span>
	<span class="relevant">user: "mycompany",</span>
	<span class="relevant">password: "CHANGEIT",</span>
});
...</p>

<p>Note: you can define more than one backend servers, and reference them later.

<p>Next, edit <code>submission/queues.js</code> and uncomment the indirect 
sender definition.
Your configuration should look like this:
<p class="code">...
immediateSender = setup(<span class="relevant">IndirectImmediateSender</span>, {
	mailToHostTransmitter: mailToHostTransmitter,
	<span class="relevant">backendServer: backendServer</span>,
});
...</p>

<h3>Load balancing</h3>
It is also possible to use more than one smarthosts. Mireka provides basic load 
balancing using the <code>weight</code> and <code>backup</code> properties of backend servers. For example:

<p class="code">...
upstream = setup(Upstream, {
	servers: [
		setup(BackendServer, {
			host: "smtp1.example.com",
			<span class="relevant">weight: 60,</span>
		}),
		setup(BackendServer, {
			host: "smtp2.example.com",
			<span class="relevant">weight: 40,</span>
		}),
		setup(BackendServer, {
			host: "backup.example.com",
			<span class="relevant">backup: true,</span>
		}),
	],
});
immediateSender = setup(IndirectImmediateSender, {
	mailToHostTransmitter: mailToHostTransmitter,
	<span class="relevant">upstream: upstream,</span>
});
...</p>
