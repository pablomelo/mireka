<h1>How to Configure Mireka</h1>
		
<h3>Container: Resin Application Server</h3>
<p>Mireka is using the Resin application server for configuration and startup.
Therefore it is distibuted in a standard Java Web Application archive, although 
currently it has no web interface. In the unlikely event, that some additonal  
configuration of Resin is needed, other than what was already done during 
installation, you can find more information about Resin on its web site at
<a href="http://www.caucho.com/products/resin/">http://www.caucho.com/products/resin/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Mail services</h3>
<p>
Mireka configuration files are located in the <kbd>${mirekaHome}/conf/</kbd> 
directory.
</p>

<p>
<kbd>mireka.xml</kbd> is the primary configuration file of Mireka. 
It is imported by 
<kbd>resin-web.xml</kbd> in the Mireka web application archive during runtime. 
<kbd>mireka.xml</kbd> in turn imports most of the other configuration 
files. 
</p>

<p>
These configuration files will be read and processed by Resin. 
Essentially, they control what objects must be created in runtime. The name of a tag 
is a Java class name. An element assigns a value to a property of the object. 
It is also possible to specify another objest as a property value, either 
defining it inline, or referencing it by an EL expression.    
For more information on the syntax, see the Resin documentation.
</p>

<p>
For more information on the Mireka classes which are referenced in the 
configuration, see the <a href="javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>.
</p>

<p>
The import structure of configuration files should be considered as an example. 
It is possible to include all data in <kbd>mireka.xml</kbd>. It is also possible 
to divide the configuration into more files than what is supplied by default.  
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>mireka.xml</th><td>Enables/disables MX and 
Submission services. It contains a few elements used by both services:
<ul>
<li>the backend server. It specifies the server, to where mails are relayed for 
delivery or submission. It is used by the relay filter. By default both sevices 
use the same backend server, however this is not required. 
<li>the list of users of the Submission service. Although this list is primarily 
used in the Submision service, the users also appear as valid recipients in the 
MX service.
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><th><a href="mx.html">mx</a></th><td>Configuration files related to the MX 
service, which receives mails sent to the local domains by any server on the 
internet. The service, in turn, relays all received mails to the backend server.
</td></tr>
<tr><th><a href="submission.html">submission</a></th><td>Configuration files 
related to the Submission service, used by local users to send mails to either 
other local users, or to other domains on the internet. The service, in turn, 
relays all submitted mails to the backend server.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>
<kbd>${mirekaHome}/conf/logback.xml</kbd> configures logging.
For more information, see the documentation of 
<a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a> and the  
<a href="administration.html">Administration</a> section.
