/*
	Simple mailing lists. This implementation is appropriate for small, 
	internal, closed membership lists. There is no archiving,  
	automatized subscription/unsubscription address, moderation etc.
	If the requirements are more complex, then a dedicated list manager 
	application should be used, like SubEthaMail, which can be easily 
	integrated with Mireka or it can be used stand-alone on a subdomain.
	
	For more information on the individual configuration elements see the 
	Javadoc documentation in the doc/javadoc directory. For an overview read
	the documentation in the doc directory.
